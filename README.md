# Task Answer

>Describe how Shortcode should work: [cn_dashboard] for the Dashboard page. On this page, 2 widgets should display the current number of freelancers and tasks in the system.

I think this shortcode should work as follows.  
First, we get the current number of freelancers and tasks and display on the page. 
If there is a need to keep track of the moment, without reloading the page, then using javascript, set the time interval and send the Ajax request at the desired time intervals and update the number of freelancers and tasks.
